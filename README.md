Please note that the following packages are required to run the project and will need to be installed: 

1-XR Package Manager 

2-XR Interaction Toolkit and its samples: Starter Assets and XR Device Simulator.

3-Text Mesh Pro

Under assets you will see folders marked from 1 to 5. 
Each folder contains its appropriate answer. 
Those with scenes can be run. 
Question 5 has a scene that contain elements of all the questions together as one. 
Teleport or move over to the table where there is a screen allowing you to add either construction workers or city planners to the citizen list.

===========IMPORTANT===========

1-Question 3 and 5 seemed to refer to depricated classes, I answered them using the newest methodologies as closely as I could especially since I was using the newest XR Interaction Toolkit V3.
